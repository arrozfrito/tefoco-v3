# Tefoco V3

it uses nodejs v12 and it only uses discord v11.6.4 and idk the opus but it doesnt matter anyway

i made it just to learn how to use js so dont expect it to update a lot

replace the process.env.token thing with the bot token (on quotes)

## Command list:

$yeet (optional name for the things)- makes a lot of text channels and vcs, and roles, changes the server's name and pings everyone on the new channels

$del - yeets all the channels and only leaves one

$admall - self explanatory

$servername (new server name) - self explanatory

$antiprotector - bans xenon (backup bot), betterantispam and some captcha bots (dunno if its working)

$yes (vc id) - plays some weebness //please for love of god dont hate on this command, i spent almost 1 hour just to find the proper ffmpeg buildpack for heroku and the opus package for this bot

$hentai (vc id) - plays some hornyness //the song is shooting star technica by ptpd if anyone wonders

$help - ...
